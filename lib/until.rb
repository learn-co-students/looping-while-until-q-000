#this one took me alot longer than it should have, because i didnt realize i mispelled Winguardium. This is the second time ive made this kind of mistake. it took me like 2 minutes to write the actual code for both, but probably an hour and some help from someone who didnt catch it either, to finally get this to pass -_-
#i almost forgot, but loops and times commands need do to go after it.
